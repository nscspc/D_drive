RAMANUJAN :-

Srinivasa Ramanujan, (born December 22, 1887, Erode, India—died April 26, 1920, Kumbakonam).

This was the man who knew infinity and beyond, a genius in his own right. Armed with an extraordinary intellect and a thrust to follow his passions; he set the world of mathematics buzzing with a new light.

Ramanujan was a man decades, even centuries ahead of his time. He had independently compiled nearly 3,900 results (mostly identities and equations) and nearly all his claims have now been proven correct,He was the first to determine the infinite series of p (pie). He had an uncanny ability to recognise the inherent properties of numbers.

He had faced such a time when he had no money to buy himself two square meals, leave alone notebooks and ink. He used to work out his theorems on a slate, such was his financial crisis. But he persevered over all these hardships to become the man that we know today.

He was a self-taught genius; with almost no formal education in higher level Mathematics.

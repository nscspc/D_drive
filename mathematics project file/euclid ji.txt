EUCLID :-

Although Euclid is a famous mathematician, very little is known about his life. It is believed that he was a student of Plato. Euclid was born around 365 B.C. in Alexandria, Egypt and lived until about 300 B.C. Euclid's most famous work is his collection of 13 books, dealing with geometry, called The Elements. They are said to be " the most studied books apart from the Bible".

Euclid actually made few discoveries. He did make a few, but very minute ones. Euclidean geometry is the study of points, lines, planes, and other geometric figures.

Euclid is often referred to as the “Father of Geometry”, and he wrote perhaps the most important and successful mathematical textbook of all time

ISAAC NEWTON :-

Isaac Newton was born on January 4, 1643, in Woolsthorpe,Lincolnshire, England.

Newton’s mother wanted him to be a farmer. His mother even pulled him out of school. Isaac Newton felt farming was very monotonous and he wasn’t cut out for that. He was sent back to school after he failed terribly in farming. Newton was fascinated by advanced sciences even as a child.

Newton made contributions to all branches of mathematics then studied, but is especially famous for his solutions to the contemporary problems in analytical geometry of drawing tangents to curves (differentiation) and defining areas bounded by curves (integration).
Around this time, the debate over Newton’s claims to originating the field of calculus exploded into a nasty dispute.

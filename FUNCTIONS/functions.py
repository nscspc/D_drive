   You can pass data, known as parameters, into a function.

    A function can return data as a result.


=>Arguments are often shortened to args in Python documentations .


=>Parameters or Arguments?
   The terms parameter and argument can be used for the same thing: information that are passed into a function.

    From a function's perspective:

    A parameter is the variable listed inside the parentheses in the function definition.

    An argument is the value that is sent to the function when it is called.
